### Introduction  
  The first idea for this bot was to scrape a webpage for lectures for our class and notify us in Discord every morning on time, place and subject. However that webpage wasn't always very up to date, so I had to give up that idea. I did learn web scraping in .NET though. Most of the info for our class courses and lectures are in published in Notion, and when I got access to that DB the idea worked much better, each morning the bot looks for lectures and notifies us. Other features have been added, like notifications on when a voice channel is joined and responding to certain words and phrases.
