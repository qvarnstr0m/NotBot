### Introduction  
  The first idea for this bot was to scrape a webpage for lectures for our class and notify us in Discord every morning on time, place and subject. However that webpage wasn't always very up to date, so I had to give up that idea. I did learn web scraping in .NET though. Most of the info for our class courses and lectures are in published in Notion, and when I got access to that DB the idea worked much better, each morning the bot looks for lectures and notifies us. Other features have been added, like notifications on when a voice channel is joined and responding to certain words and phrases.  
    
ðŸ“Œ The bot has it's [own Trello kanban board](https://trello.com/b/4FoiqnSs/notbotboard) with features to add cards in suggestion column in Discord via !addcard command. ðŸ“Œ

### Run on a server  
This bot needs to run in an enviroment that can handle .NET 6.0 apps, I have yet to find a good free one and this one runs on [serverstarter.host](https://serverstarter.host/) for a couple of $ a month. Feel free to contribute and add a list of decent bot hosting servers, free or not.
